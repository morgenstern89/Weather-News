# Go to the page "Weather and News Board":
https://weather-and-news-board.netlify.app/

Note that the APIs used for the page (1. searching weather information, 2. newscatcher) have time-limit of 30 days.
Thus, the page might not display the information on the UI after some time point.
Please refer to the UI screenshot to see how it would look when the APIs are working normally.
